    "### Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a co-worker/deal with a difficult co-worker.\n",
    "I was working as part of a team on an important project for an Australia based MNC and none of my team members had experience working with unstructured/text data so I was leading the team in terms of deciding the next steps and delegating tasks. And a team member was constantly late with completing their tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their lateness was starting to hinder the progress of the team, and so I decided to speak\n",
    "to them in private about the issue. When I spoke to them, they became defensive and slightly confrontational. They\n",
    "said they were busy, and they were working as fast as they could.\n",
    "\n",
    "I explained in a calm and positive manner that we really needed their help with getting\n",
    "the project completed, and their particular task was slowing up the completion of the\n",
    "project. I asked them if there were any Bottlenecks that they were facing and offered to assist them in their tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the conversation, they were able to complete their tasks well on time and I thanked them for being proactive in acting on the feedback. We were able to finish the project well in time. In fact that project went on to be one of the most impactful for the company that quarter. our team won the spot award which is given to 2-3 teams in the company every quarter for the impact that they made. \n",

    "### How do you communicate to non-technical stakeholders\n",
    "Tailoring your communication style to suit the needs and level of understanding of the stakeholders is an essential skill to have for a data scientist. There are a couple of steps I take to ensure success while working with non-technical stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use storytelling - I will make them understand the context and business implications of our work. Explain the problem you were trying to solve, the methods used to solve it, and the plausible business implications of those methods.\n",
    "2. Explaining the analysis methodology in plain words without technical jargons, using analogies and examples. \n",
    "3. Use charts, graphs, and other visual aids to help non-technical stakeholders understand how they relate to the overall business objective\n",
    "4. Ask for feedback: Engage your audience by asking for their feedback and input. This will help ensure that your message is understood and that you are meeting the needs of your stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Let's take a Recommender system as an example, to find/recommend similar documents to a given query document, we can represent them as vectors. These n-dimensional vectors can be thought of as two points in the 3-dimensional space and calculating the distance between tells us how similar the 2 documents are. \n",

    "As a data scientist I have worked on many impactful/challenging data projects, one that stand out is - \n",
    "Recommender system:\n",
    "- S - I was working with a fortune 100 company to develop a recommendation engine. For context, this comp sells networking hardware devices and whenever their customers faced a problem, they can go online and type in the problem they are facing and open a service request. And customer engineers would spend 2-3 hours researching for past similar service requests. \n",
    "- T - We used text data of 7.8 M past SRs and developed an information retrieval system which recommends past 10 similar SRs. \n",
    "The intuition behind the method is that we find the minimum “traveling distance” between documents, in other words the most efficient way to “move” the distribution of document 1 to the distribution of document 2.\n",
    "- A - We leveraged NLP algorithms such as word2vec and fasttext to convert NLP algorithms \n",
    "- R - This resulted in a 50% decrease in the research time, led to shorter turnaround time and better customer experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge \n",
    "- developing the cleaning pipeline for the data\n",
    "- Developing metrics to evaluate the performance of the model\n",
    "- Large dataset - had to write efficient numpy we computed the similarity metric between all documents. \n",

    "### Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership abilities \n",
    "\n",
    "I have had numerous opportunities to demonstrate leadership skills in pervious job. One instance that comes to mind is when I was leading a team of data analysts on a project with a fortune 100 networking hardware company. It was a b2b company. The quality of their customer DB was deteriorating. Sales rep would enter names of persons or addresses instead of the company name. \n",

    "### Tell me about a time you didn’t have enough data to make the right decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a data scientist is working on a project to predict customer churn for a telecom company. After analyzing the data, the data scientist realizes that they don't have enough data to build a reliable predictive model. The data set is small, and it is missing key variables that could be used to predict churn, such as customer satisfaction ratings and demographics.\n",
    "In this situation, the data scientist has a few options. They could try to gather more data to improve the model's accuracy, such as by conducting a survey or using external data sources. They could also try to identify the most important variables to include in the model and focus on improving the quality of those variables, even if the data set is still small.\n",
    "Alternatively, the data scientist could decide to report their findings to the stakeholders and recommend that more data be collected before proceeding with the project. This could involve explaining the limitations of the current data set and the potential impact on the model's accuracy, and proposing a plan for collecting additional data.\n",
    "Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific goals and constraints of the project, as well as the resources and time available. By carefully considering their options and communicating clearly with stakeholders, the data scientist can make the best decision given the available data.\n",

    "Prioritizing your work is very important for achieving your deliverables within deadlines. I always prioritize the tasks in order of the needs of the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prioritize by business impact: Focus on tasks that will have the most significant impact on the business or organization, such as tasks that will improve revenue or customer satisfaction.\n",
    "2. Prioritize by dependencies: Identity which tasks are dependent on other tasks and prioritize those that need to be completed first in order to move forward with other tasks.\n",
    "3. Prioritize by effort vs value: Evaluate the amount of effort required to complete a task versus the value it will provide and prioritize tasks that will have the most impact for the least effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the best way to prioritize tasks will depend on the specific project and your team's work environment, so it's important to find a method that works for you and your team.\n",

    "I would start by mentioning my strength as my weakness is somewhat related. I consider grit to be my greatest strength - no matter how difficult the task, I believe that I can achieve it. It allows me to stay focused and motivated in the face of setbacks and allows me to execute large challenging projects which require sustained effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, my weakness is that sometimes I get too uncomfortable to ask for help when needed because somewhere at the back of my mind, I used to perceive it as a sign of weakness, but I have learned that asking for help at the right time is a skill that needs to be developed just like any other skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have now changed the narrative from seeing it as a sign of weakness to seeing it as a sign of willingness to learn and grow.\n",

    "When I started as a data analyst in my career, in my first project, we were working to build a classification model to filter out invalid names from a customer database. I was tasked with running the model on a new dataset and reporting the performance metrics to the client. Unfortunately, I made an error and I emailed the wrong numbers. I later realized that I had missed a step during data cleaning, which led to incorrect performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I instantly sent a corrected version of the email and apologized for the oversight. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this from happening again, I implemented several processes. I made it a point to properly comment the code and started writing documentation for the project from the very beginning, documenting each step of the project and shared with all team members to ensure that everyone was on the same page regarding the technical details of the project, & took feedback. \n",
