# Data Science Interviews
Over the last few months, I have spent ungodly amounts of time preparing and interviewing for data-related roles at various companies. Let's just say, It's been a full-time commitment with no honeymoon phase, giving birth to this repo. 
I created this question bank to help other students like me who'd be going through the same phase.

Only a few questions have answers right now (WIP). Please create a PR if you want to provide an answer, improve an answer or rectify a mistake. 

There are two broad categories of questions:
* Technical: Covers topics like statistics, machine learning and deep learning.
* Behavioral: This includes questions from topics like leadership, collaboration, dealing with challenges in the workplace, etc.
