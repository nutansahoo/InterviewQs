# Data Science Interviews
Second half of 2022 and first half of 2023, I spent ungodly amounts of time preparing and interviewing for data-related roles at various companies. 
I created this question bank to help other students like me who'd be going through the same phase.

There are two broad categories of questions that one faces during the interviews while preparing for data roles:
* Technical: Covers topics like statistics, machine learning and deep learning.
* Behavioral: This includes questions from topics like leadership, collaboration, dealing with challenges in the workplace, etc. 

For now this repo **only** contains behavioral questions. I will be adding the the technical ones sometime in future.

*Note: The answers provided below are similar to those I gave during interviews, receiving positive feedback. I do not claim that the responses provided are the only correct answers to the questions. Please do not copy these answers, but rather to use them as guidance. Tailor your responses based on your own experiences, skills, and the specific requirements of your job role.*
