    "Tell me about a time you worked well as part of a team?\n",
    "As a data scientist, I have worked as part of a team on many occasions, one project that stands out to me is\n",
    "S - when we were working with a Fortune 100 networking hardware company to develop a recommender system. Customer engineers were spending 2-3 hrs every day researching relevant past service requests. Our goal was to reduce this time. \n",
    "T - I worked closely with the stakeholders, subject matter experts, and other data scientists to gain an in-depth understanding of the business challenge and data. \n",
    "A - I was responsible for data preprocessing and experimenting with different NLP models, fine-tuning and evaluating them to check which one performs the best. Throughout the project, we actively collaborated, communicated, shared ideas and seeked feedback to ensure that our work was aligned with the business objectives. This also helped us to stay organized, setting clear goals and deadlines for each sprint.\n",
    "R - Our team was able to deliver the recommendation engine which reduced the turnaround time of engineers by 50%, leading to a significant improvement in customer experience. Our ability to work as a team was key to finding success in this complex project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me about a time you didn’t have enough data to make the right decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a data scientist is working on a project to predict customer churn for a telecom company. After analyzing the data, the data scientist realizes that they don't have enough data to build a reliable predictive model. The data set is small, and it is missing key variables that could be used to predict churn, such as customer satisfaction ratings and demographics.\n",
    "In this situation, the data scientist has a few options. They could try to gather more data to improve the model's accuracy, such as by conducting a survey or using external data sources. They could also try to identify the most important variables to include in the model and focus on improving the quality of those variables, even if the data set is still small.\n",
    "Alternatively, the data scientist could decide to report their findings to the stakeholders and recommend that more data be collected before proceeding with the project. This could involve explaining the limitations of the current data set and the potential impact on the model's accuracy, and proposing a plan for collecting additional data.\n",
    "Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific goals and constraints of the project, as well as the resources and time available. By carefully considering their options and communicating clearly with stakeholders, the data scientist can make the best decision given the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you work under pressure?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you Prioritize your work?\n",
    "Prioritizing your work is very important for achieving your deliverables within deadlines. I always prioritize the tasks in order of the needs of the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prioritize by business impact: Focus on tasks that will have the most significant impact on the business or organization, such as tasks that will improve revenue or customer satisfaction.\n",
    "2. Prioritize by dependencies: Identity which tasks are dependent on other tasks and prioritize those that need to be completed first in order to move forward with other tasks.\n",
    "3. Prioritize by effort vs value: Evaluate the amount of effort required to complete a task versus the value it will provide and prioritize tasks that will have the most impact for the least effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the best way to prioritize tasks will depend on the specific project and your team's work environment, so it's important to find a method that works for you and your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "All deliverables are on track to be completed on schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What are your weaknesses?\n",
    "I would start by mentioning my strength as my weakness is somewhat related. I consider grit to be my greatest strength - no matter how difficult the task, I believe that I can achieve it. It allows me to stay focused and motivated in the face of setbacks and allows me to execute large challenging projects which require sustained effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, my weakness is that sometimes I get too uncomfortable to ask for help when needed because somewhere at the back of my mind, I used to perceive it as a sign of weakness, but I have learned that asking for help at the right time is a skill that needs to be developed just like any other skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have now changed the narrative from seeing it as a sign of weakness to seeing it as a sign of willingness to learn and grow. I have learned to ask for help by articulating the challenges I am facing and the steps I have already taken to solve it. I believe this is an essential aspect of teamwork and collaboration. It not only improves the outcomes of the project but also help build a stronger relationship with my colleagues. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Optional]\n",
    "Additionally, asking for help can not only improve the quality of my work but also help build stronger relationships with my colleagues. I have been actively working on building my comfort level in asking for help and seeking out the expertise of others. I find that this not only improves the outcome of projects but also allows for a more collaborative and inclusive work environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me about a time you made a mistake/Tell me about a time you failed.  \n",
    "When I started as a data analyst in my career, in my first project, we were working to build a classification model to filter out invalid names from a customer database. I was tasked with running the model on a new dataset and reporting the performance metrics to the client. Unfortunately, I made an error and I emailed the wrong numbers. I later realized that I had missed a step during data cleaning, which led to incorrect performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I instantly sent a corrected version of the email and apologized for the oversight. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this from happening again, I implemented several processes. I made it a point to properly comment the code and started writing documentation for the project from the very beginning, documenting each step of the project and shared with all team members to ensure that everyone was on the same page regarding the technical details of the project, & took feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "The clients appreciated that we took accountability, were proactive in rectifying it and worked to maintain transparency throughout the project. This helped us earn their trust quickly and they chose to work with us on another impactful data project the following year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes you stand out from other candidates? What can you bring to the role?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are particularly two things which make me stand out from other candidates:\n",
    "\n",
    "My knowledge and expertise in data analysis have been built over many years in different organizations and through my education. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have extensive experience of working in the full life-cycle of data projects in different industries. This cross-sectoral experience as a data scientist combined with my education has helped me develop a strong analytical mindset combined with business acumen. I am able to identify opportunities in the business where analytics can create an impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am able to effectively formulate an analytical or data science problem from a business challenge. \n",
    "And know how to drive data projects and effectively communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. I have a strong record of problem solving and working under pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have experience leading teams in my previous job. I have provided guidance and support in the use of statistical methodology and building data analysis pipelines, and believe in fostering a collaborative and supportive environment where my mentees feel comfortable asking questions, seeking guidance, and sharing their ideas and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "My greatest strength is grit - no matter how difficult the task is, I believe I am capable with achieving it with enough practice and time. It allows me to stay focused and motivated while working on large challenging projects which require sustained effort. \n"
